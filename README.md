# VR interior design + version management demo

I made this project as a starter task for entry into the Human-AI Lab at the University of Michigan. 
The requirements were to make a VR app where the user could manipulate furniture items and save the room in various states.
Then the user would be able to see their room history and navigate to previous versions of the room. 

To make this project, I used the Mixed Reality Toolkit's object manipulation functionality, and I build the save system
and all other aspects of the projects from scratch in Unity. This project was developed for the Meta Quest 2 headset.
